This is intended as a substitute for the OS/2 "System Clock" object.
The main new feature is setting the time zone, and adjusting the
clock at the appropriate summer start/end time.

There are two executables in this package. TZset.exe should be
started at system startup (e.g. via the Startup folder), and
it runs in the background (and spends most of its time sleeping).
Clock.exe is the user interface.
