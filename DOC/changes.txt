CHANGE RECORD

Version 1.0          ( 8 Oct 2020)
    New version numbering sequence.
    Major redesign to separate the user interface from
       the daemon that waits for a time zone change
       to happen.  (See manual.)

Version 09
   Fixed: crash when the TZ string contained a negative
      "seconds after midnight" value.
   Updated TZOnce to show the next time zone changes in
      the future, rather than in the current year.
   Tidied up source code to make it more readable.

Version 08
   Removed a duplicate "Summer time ends" message.

Version 07
   Changed the "US default rules" to reflect changes to the
      summer time start and end dates for those states that
      respect the federal standard.
   Fixed: start/end dates for the following year were
      incorrect.  Those dates were relevant for any case
      where the summer is already over.
   Display change: the screen output messages use more
      human-friendly date formats than the internal format.
   Display change: we don't display the minutes until the
      next change unless it is really close.  Before that we
      display hours or days, as appropriate.
   Added an icon.
